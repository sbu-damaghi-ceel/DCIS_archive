## Introduction

In this study, we [provide a brief summary of the study, including the main objectives, methods, and findings]. This repository contains all the necessary code and data to reproduce the analyses presented in the paper.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following software installed:

- [Software 1] (e.g., Python 3.8+)
- [Software 2] (e.g., R 4.0+)
- [Software 3] (e.g., Docker)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis, run the `pipeline.sh` script. This script will execute all the steps in the analysis pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and result generation.

```bash
bash pipeline.sh
```

## Analysis Pipeline

The `pipeline.sh` script contains the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this step, we perform initial investigations to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions.
3. **Model Training**: This step includes training the models used in the study.
4. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the models and summarize the results.
5. **Result Generation**: This step involves generating the figures and tables presented in the paper.

Each step is documented and the code is modularized for ease of understanding and modification.
